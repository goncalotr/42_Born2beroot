# BornToBerooot (42 School)

## Overview

This repository contains reference configuration files and scripts used during the completion of the **BornToBerooot** project at 42 School. The project involves setting up a secure virtual machine using basic system administration principles, in this case, on Debian.

**Important:** This repository does *not* contain the virtual machine image itself, nor does it provide an automated setup. The files here are intended solely as **reference examples** from one successful project setup.

## Purpose of this Repository

The files included here serve as examples for configurations required by the BornToBerooot subject, such as:

*   SSH server configuration (`sshd_config`)
*   The `monitoring.sh` script for system status display

You can browse these files to see how specific requirements were met in this particular instance.

## Disclaimer

These files are provided for **reference and educational purposes only**. They reflect the specific choices and environment used for *this* project completion.

*   **Do not blindly copy and paste** these configurations onto your own system without understanding their implications.
*   Always refer to the official **BornToBerooot subject PDF** for the definitive requirements.
*   Security configurations should be carefully reviewed and adapted to your specific needs and environment.

Use these files as a guide or comparison point while working on your own BornToBerooot project.
